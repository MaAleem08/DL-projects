We will be using ECG dataset throughout this article. ECG stands for Electrocardiogram.
It checks how your heart is functioning by measuring the electrical activities of your heart. 
An electrical pulse travels through the heart in each heartbeat, creating muscles to squeeze and pump blood to the heart. 
It carries the electrical impulse that helps the doctor know if the heart is pumping normally or strange. 
So we will take this dataset and build an anomaly detector using Autoencoder.
