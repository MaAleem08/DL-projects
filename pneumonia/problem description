According to WHO, every year over 150 million people are infected with pneumonia particularly kids below the age of 5 years. 
One in three deaths in India are caused due to pneumonia as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Chest X-rays are at the moment, the best available method for diagnosing pneumonia, and therefore play a crucial role in diagnosing
and providing clinical care to the ones affected.
However, detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays is a challenging task that relies on the availability of expert radiologists. 
Experts are either not available in remote areas or most people can’t afford it. 
Under such circumstances, automating the detection of diseases through AI becomes the need of the hour. 
there are at least 2 yearly competitions on Kaggle hosted by research organizations, where the goal is to detect an ailment from medical images. 
We are going to do something similar here. 
We’ll build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that uses X-ray images of the lungs to detect pneumonia in patients.
